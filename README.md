Email engin with interface.

With this app is possible to add subscribers to airtable database.

CAMPAIGNS is second working database, it allows to store all send campaigns and drafts.

Create campaign is place for sending email. It is connect with mailgun.

Every mail is send to all subscribers and then is stored in campaign database as send or draft.

Every draft can be deleted or edit and send.

Mailgun engin is disabled for this task. Needs to change subscription plan.

But all code is inside mailgun folder, is tested and its ready to use in my future projects.
